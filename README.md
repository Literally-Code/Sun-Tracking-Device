# Sun-Tracking Device (Embedded C++)
This is an embedded software project for a solar-tracking device that adjusts its position based on sunlight intensity using photoresistors and servos.

## 📌 Features:
- C/C++ firmware- for microcontroller-based control
- Sensor data processing- using light-dependent resistors (LDRs)
- Real-time motor control- to adjust positioning
- Adaptive delay logic- for smoother tracking

## 🔧 How It Works:
- Reads sensor values from four LDRs
- Compares light levels and adjusts servo motors accordingly
- Serial output for **debugging and monitoring values**

## 🔍 Key Learnings:
- Embedded sensor integration*
- Real-time control systems in C/C++
- Debugging and optimizing servo movement logic

## 📂 Files:
- `Suntracker.cpp` - Main logic
